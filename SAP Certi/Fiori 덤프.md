**Questions :** SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

Thanks a lot to all of you, my friends for anycodings_manifest.json your help and advices. Guys, I think I anycodings_manifest.json solved the problem, almost. Just need your anycodings_manifest.json help with this moment: My Table get data anycodings_manifest.json from mock server, but doesn't show it to anycodings_manifest.json user. Instead of the rows it shows an empty anycodings_manifest.json table where the rows count is equal to the anycodings_manifest.json data in my mockserver file. I mean: At the anycodings_manifest.json moment, in "ZMA_BPSet" there'se 8 rows. anycodings_manifest.json Because of this you can see 8 rows in anycodings_manifest.json table. Can anybody help me?

## **Answers 1 :** of SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

rootUri is used to determine the path of anycodings_mockserver the OData service that should by anycodings_mockserver intercepted by the mock server. It anycodings_mockserver should always correspond to the service anycodings_mockserver uri of your OData service specified in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json.

So, if you have this in your manifest

```json
"dataSources": {
    "mainService": {
        "uri": "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/",
        "type": "OData",
        "settings": {
            "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml"
        }
    }
},
```

your mock server constructor should look anycodings_mockserver like this:

```csharp
var oMockServer = new MockServer({
    rootUri: "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/"
});
```

Note that the rootUri must always have a anycodings_mockserver trailing slash. If your service url in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json does not have one, make anycodings_mockserver sure that rootUri does.

You don't have to change anything in anycodings_mockserver your manifest.json. All test setups are anycodings_mockserver done in mockServer.html and its anycodings_mockserver referenced files.

## When should you not use the dynamic page layout? 

## (Choose the correct answers). 

### You are planning to use SAP Fiori elements, such as the list report, analytical list page, overview page, or object page, which already incorporates the dynamic page layout. 

You are building a freestyle application that uses the dynamic page header and footer toolbar features of SAP Fiori 2.0 (versions 1.40 and higher) 

### You want to implement an initial page or object page floor plan. These floor plans already incorporate snapping header and footer toolbar features. The behavior is comparable to the dynamic page behavior, but the technical foundation is different. 

You are building an analytical application that is using the sap.viz API. 

### You only need to display a small amount of information. In this case, use a dialog instead. If you cannot avoid using the dynamic page layout, use letterboxing to mitigate the issue.

Save the browser response which is called <entity type name>.json, for example Mock.json and put it into the mock data folder. Add the path to the simulate function
