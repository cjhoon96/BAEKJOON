**Questions :** SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

Thanks a lot to all of you, my friends for anycodings_manifest.json your help and advices. Guys, I think I anycodings_manifest.json solved the problem, almost. Just need your anycodings_manifest.json help with this moment: My Table get data anycodings_manifest.json from mock server, but doesn't show it to anycodings_manifest.json user. Instead of the rows it shows an empty anycodings_manifest.json table where the rows count is equal to the anycodings_manifest.json data in my mockserver file. I mean: At the anycodings_manifest.json moment, in "ZMA_BPSet" there'se 8 rows. anycodings_manifest.json Because of this you can see 8 rows in anycodings_manifest.json table. Can anybody help me?

## **Answers 1 :** of SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

rootUri is used to determine the path of anycodings_mockserver the OData service that should by anycodings_mockserver intercepted by the mock server. It anycodings_mockserver should always correspond to the service anycodings_mockserver uri of your OData service specified in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json.

So, if you have this in your manifest

```json
"dataSources": {
    "mainService": {
        "uri": "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/",
        "type": "OData",
        "settings": {
            "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml"
        }
    }
},
```

your mock server constructor should look anycodings_mockserver like this:

```csharp
var oMockServer = new MockServer({
    rootUri: "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/"
});
```

Note that the rootUri must always have a anycodings_mockserver trailing slash. If your service url in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json does not have one, make anycodings_mockserver sure that rootUri does.

You don't have to change anything in anycodings_mockserver your manifest.json. All test setups are anycodings_mockserver done in mockServer.html and its anycodings_mockserver referenced files.
