## Does the invocation of the getProperty() method on an OData model object trigger a request to the backend? (Choose the correct answer).

Yes, for each getProperty() call, an synchronous request to the OData service is triggered to get the property value.

It depends on how the getProperty() method is parametrized by the developer. There is a property called bFetchFromServer . If this parameter is true, a request to the server-side is sent.
