## What parameter must you provide when calling the simulate function of the mock server? 

## (Choose the correct answer). 

The full qualified path to the model and the URI for the service document. 

### The full qualified path to the local metadata file and the folder where the model data are stored locally. 

The autoRespondAfter parameter and the full qualified path to the local metadata file.

**Mock data** (json files)

You can let the mock server generate random mock data automatically based on services metadata. For this, provide only the path to the metadata file and omit the second parameter of the simulate function as follows:

// url to the service metadata document

​    var sMetadataUrl = "testdata/rmtsampleflight/metadata.xml";

​    oMockServer.simulate(sMetadataUrl);

You can provide your own mock data in .json files, which can either be created manually or saved from an OData service response. Mock data in JSON format can be generated from an OData service by adding the $format=json parameter to the URL. Save the browser response which is called <entity type name>.json, for example Mock.json and put it into the mock data folder. Add the path to the simulate function

**Questions :** SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

Thanks a lot to all of you, my friends for anycodings_manifest.json your help and advices. Guys, I think I anycodings_manifest.json solved the problem, almost. Just need your anycodings_manifest.json help with this moment: My Table get data anycodings_manifest.json from mock server, but doesn't show it to anycodings_manifest.json user. Instead of the rows it shows an empty anycodings_manifest.json table where the rows count is equal to the anycodings_manifest.json data in my mockserver file. I mean: At the anycodings_manifest.json moment, in "ZMA_BPSet" there'se 8 rows. anycodings_manifest.json Because of this you can see 8 rows in anycodings_manifest.json table. Can anybody help me?

## **Answers 1 :** of SAPUI5 Problem with rootUri in Mock Sever

rootUri is used to determine the path of anycodings_mockserver the OData service that should by anycodings_mockserver intercepted by the mock server. It anycodings_mockserver should always correspond to the service anycodings_mockserver uri of your OData service specified in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json.

So, if you have this in your manifest

```json
"dataSources": {
    "mainService": {
        "uri": "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/",
        "type": "OData",
        "settings": {
            "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml"
        }
    }
},
```

your mock server constructor should look anycodings_mockserver like this:

```csharp
var oMockServer = new MockServer({
    rootUri: "/sap/opu/odata/your-service/"
});
```

Note that the rootUri must always have a anycodings_mockserver trailing slash. If your service url in anycodings_mockserver manifest.json does not have one, make anycodings_mockserver sure that rootUri does.

You don't have to change anything in anycodings_mockserver your manifest.json. All test setups are anycodings_mockserver done in mockServer.html and its anycodings_mockserver referenced files.

- **Controller hooks**: Controller hooks are predefined and documented enhancement options which are documented and promised to be stable across application lifecycle. A new documented function name is used as a hook, and the developer needs to implement (code) this function in the custom controller.

  

- **Controller replacement**: In the controller replacement technique, standard controller is replaced by a custom controller in the extension project. A typed controller can be extended only using this technique.

  

- **Extension project**: This is a new SAPUI5 project in a customer’s namespace, where all extension-related artifacts are stored. The component of the extension project extends the standard component.

  

- **Extension point**: These are predefined places within the SAPUI5 code acting as anchor points for extensions. These are documented and kept safe so that extensions created by customers are safe across upgrades.

  

- **UI controller hooks**: This is a type of extension point for the controller. These are methods within the standard controller that allow customers to define its content.

  

- **View extension**: View extension is a technique of using extension points to enhance views. An extension point is assigned to a custom view or a fragment, whose content will be plugged into the enhanced view.

  

- **View modification**: This is one of the view enhancement techniques which involves changing properties of the view by customizing entries in manifest.json file of the app. However, visible is the only property that can be influenced with the latest version of SAPUI5.

  

- **View replacement**: As the name suggests, this technique is used to replace the standard view with a custom view. Developer has a complete freedom to define content of the custom view. This technique is suitable whenever any of the standard enhancement options do not suit the requirements.

****





## What is meant by the phrase “SAPUI5 supports modification free enhancements”? (Choose the correct answer). 

The developer must create a copy of the application that should be enhanced and the enhancement is done in the copy. 

### The delivered standard application remains unchanged and hence the extension is considered to be modification free. 

SAP provides a service in the cloud to generate an enhanced application using aspect-oriented programming.
